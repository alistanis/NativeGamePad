This work is heavily inspired by SDL2, and as such, even though this library
is wrapping only native platform libraries, I have taken a few liberties with
enums, macros, and function signatures from SDL. As such I say a large thank you
to SDL2, its many contributors, and Sam Lantinga. Attribution for the inspiration
of this work and the subsequent license from SDL:
